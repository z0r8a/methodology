# Architectural Design Flaws
  - Lack of Defense-in-Depth: Failure to apply multiple layers of security across the system.
  - Overly Complex Architecture: Complex and convoluted designs make the system harder to secure.
  - Improper Separation of Duties: Failure to enforce strict role-based separation, allowing for too much privilege in one entity.
  - Single Point of Failure: A critical component failure leads to full system compromise.
  - Lack of Redundancy and Scalability: Lack of failover mechanisms or scalability compromises availability.
  - Insecure Microservices Communication: Unsecured communication between microservices or containers, enabling unauthorized access.
  - Hardcoding Sensitive Data in Architecture: Sensitive data hardcoded in configuration files, scripts, or code.
